# Object Detection

A small project utilizing RetinaNet object detection module developed by **Tsung-Yi Lin at Facebook AI Research (FAIR)**, implemented with **Keras**, (the original project by FAIR is called [**Detectron**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron)).  For the paper and libraries used, see References below.  For installation, see instructions

# Steps taken inside the code

  1. Declare object detection module as implemented by [**AI Commons**](https://commons.specpal.science/projects/)
  2. Set *RetinaNet* as the model type.
  3. Use a pre-trained model.  You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/releases) or on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) (search yourself.)
  4. Magic

That's it.

# Did you make the whole thing?

No.  As said, I am only using algorithms and pre-trained models that were developed by **FAIR** and **ImageAI**.  The reason why this is on GitHub is because later on I'm planning to do use it for future projects.  The reason why it's public is because of **Contributor Agreements**, so this project, despite having *30 lines of code*, has to be open-sourced.
